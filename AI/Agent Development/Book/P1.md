# Agentic Design Patterns: Chapter Summaries

# Chapter 1: Prompt Chaining  


## Core Concepts  
• Linking multiple prompts so each step builds on the previous one  
• Passing intermediate outputs as structured inputs  
• Breaking complex tasks into smaller reasoning segments  
• Maintaining context consistency across the chain  
• Reducing error by validating outputs between steps  

## Why This Matters  
• Prompt chaining creates reliable multi step reasoning  
• It enables agents to perform complex tasks with predictable outcomes  

# Chapter 2: Routing  


## Core Concepts  
• Directing queries to the correct model, tool, or workflow  
• Using classifiers or heuristics to decide which route to follow  
• Splitting tasks based on type, difficulty, or content  
• Implementing fallback paths for errors or uncertainty  
• Improving efficiency by avoiding unnecessary model calls  

## Why This Matters  
• Routing ensures the right part of the system handles the right task  
• It increases accuracy and reduces cost for agent pipelines  

# Chapter 3: Parallelization  


## Core Concepts  
• Running multiple operations at the same time  
• Accelerating processing for large datasets  
• Reducing latency for multi step work  
• Merging or reconciling outputs at the end  
• Using concurrency to scale workloads  

## Why This Matters  
• Parallelization is critical for agents that analyze large volumes of information  
• It makes agents significantly faster and more efficient  

# Chapter 4: Reflection  


## Core Concepts  
• Allowing the model to evaluate and critique its own output  
• Producing a revised or improved version after reflection  
• Checking for logic errors or inconsistencies  
• Using self evaluation loops to refine reasoning  
• Strengthening reliability through iterative improvement  

## Why This Matters  
• Reflection allows agents to self correct  
• It reduces hallucination and enhances result quality  

# Chapter 5: Tool Use  


## Core Concepts  
• Enabling agents to call external tools and APIs  
• Using functions for calculations, searches, or data processing  
• Combining LLM reasoning with deterministic tools  
• Deciding when to call a tool versus when to reason internally  
• Ensuring safe and controlled execution of tools  

## Why This Matters  
• Tool use turns an LLM into a true agent  
• It allows agents to perform real world actions and solve complex tasks  

# Chapter 6: Planning  


## Core Concepts  
• Generating step by step plans for complex tasks  
• Breaking tasks into structured subgoals  
• Updating the plan based on failures or new information  
• Monitoring progress toward the goal  
• Backtracking when necessary to correct the plan  

## Why This Matters  
• Planning is core to agent autonomy  
• It allows the agent to operate strategically rather than reactively  

# Chapter 7: Multi-Agent Collaboration  


## Core Concepts  
• Multiple agents working together on coordinated tasks  
• Assigning specialized roles to different agents  
• Passing information between agents in structured form  
• Establishing communication protocols or negotiation rules  
• Combining strengths of different agent types  

## Why This Matters  
• Multi agent systems achieve results that a single LLM cannot  
• Collaboration enables division of labor, specialization, and scalability
