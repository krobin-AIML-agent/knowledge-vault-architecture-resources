# Agentic Design Patterns: Appendix Summaries  

---

# Appendix A: Advanced Prompting Techniques  


## Core Concepts  
• Structured prompting using defined formats and constraints  
• Role prompting to stabilize model behavior  
• Context layering to control the flow of information  
• Self critique loops for refinement and verification  
• Reusable prompting patterns including trees, rubrics, and templates  

## Why This Matters  
• Advanced prompting is the foundation of agent behavior  
• Agents depend on predictable formatting, stable roles, and multi step reasoning to coordinate actions reliably

# Appendix B: AI Agentic Interactions: From GUI to Real World Environment  


## Core Concepts  
• How agents interact with graphical interfaces  
• How agents trigger actions inside applications and system components  
• Environmental awareness and state based feedback  
• Safety boundaries that restrict or validate certain actions  
• The perceive → reason → act cycle used in agentic design  

## Why This Matters  
• Modern agents extend beyond chat interfaces  
• They operate across applications, APIs, and external environments, enabling real automation workflows

# Appendix C: Quick Overview of Agentic Frameworks  


## Core Concepts  
• Memory modules  
• Planning and execution modules  
• Routing logic for tool selection  
• Tool execution layers for system interaction  
• High level workflow abstractions  

## Example Frameworks (General)  
• LangChain  
• LlamaIndex  
• OpenAI Assistants API  
• CrewAI  
• Autogen  

## Why This Matters  
• Framework choice determines how easily agents are built  
• It also determines how they integrate tools and how they scale into production

# Appendix D: Building an Agent with AgentSpace  


## Core Concepts  
• Node based agent construction  
• Message passing between agent nodes  
• Lightweight wrappers around LLM reasoning  
• Composable and modular flow design for agents  

## Why This Matters  
• AgentSpace demonstrates how complex systems emerge from simple components  
• It is ideal for rapid experimentation and instructional use

# Appendix E: AI Agents on the CLI  


## Core Concepts  
• Command line based input and output flows  
• Local system tool execution through shell commands  
• Environment variable usage and secure configuration  
• File based context windows for logs or state  
• Automation through simple loops and scripts  

## Typical Use Cases  
• Developer assistants  
• Local automation bots  
• Scripting helpers  
• Fast prototyping environments  

## Why This Matters  
• CLI agents are lightweight and portable  
• They run locally without servers or graphical interfaces

# Appendix F: Under the Hood: Inside the Agent’s Reasoning Engines  


## Core Concepts  
• Chain of thought processes  
• Reflection and self evaluation loops  
• Planner and executor separation  
• Intermediate reasoning traces  
• Uncertainty and error detection  

## Why This Matters  
• Reasoning engines transform LLMs into dynamic solvers  
• Planning, critique, and iteration produce goal aligned behavior  

---

# Appendix G: Coding Agents  


## Core Concepts  
• Agent class structure and state management  
• Tool invocation through functions and APIs  
• Event loops for controlling agent execution  
• Context handling methods  
• Error management and debugging  

## Why This Matters  
• Coding brings theoretical patterns into deployable software  
• Implementation skills create real world agent systems
