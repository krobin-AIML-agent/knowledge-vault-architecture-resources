# Appendix A: Advanced Prompting Techniques  
(Cited from uploaded file Appendix A_ Advanced Prompting Techniques.pdf)  

## Core Concepts  
Structured prompting using defined formats and constraints  
Role prompting to stabilize model behavior  
Context layering to control the flow of information  
Self critique loops for refinement and verification  
Reusable prompting patterns including trees, rubrics, and templates  

## Why This Matters  
Advanced prompting is the foundation of agent behavior.  
Agents depend on predictable formatting, stable roles, and multi step reasoning to coordinate actions reliably.

# Appendix B: AI Agentic Interactions: From GUI to Real World Environment  
(Cited from uploaded file Appendix B - AI Agentic Interactions_ From GUI to Real world environment.pdf)  

## Core Concepts  
How agents interact with graphical interfaces  
How agents trigger actions inside applications and system components  
Environmental awareness and state based feedback  
Safety boundaries that restrict or validate certain actions  
The perceive → reason → act cycle used in agentic design  

## Why This Matters  
Modern agents extend beyond chat interfaces.  
They operate across applications, APIs, and external environments, enabling real automation workflows.

# Appendix C: Quick Overview of Agentic Frameworks  
(Cited from uploaded file Appendix C - Quick overview of Agentic Frameworks.pdf)  

## Core Concepts  
Memory modules  
Planning and execution modules  
Routing logic for tool selection  
Tool execution layers for system interaction  
High level workflow abstractions  

## Example Frameworks (General)  
LangChain  
LlamaIndex  
OpenAI Assistants API  
CrewAI  
Autogen  

## Why This Matters  
Framework choice determines how easily agents are built, how they integrate tools, and how they scale.

# Appendix D: Building an Agent with AgentSpace  
(Cited from uploaded file Appendix D - Building an Agent with AgentSpace (on-line only).pdf)  

## Core Concepts  
Node based agent construction  
Message passing between nodes  
Lightweight wrappers around LLM reasoning  
Composable and modular flow design for agents  

## Why This Matters  
AgentSpace demonstrates how complex systems can emerge from simple modular components.  
It is ideal for rapid experimentation and instructional use.

# Appendix E: AI Agents on the CLI  
(Cited from uploaded file Appendix E - AI Agents on the CLI.pdf)  

## Core Concepts  
Command line based input and output flows  
Local system tool execution  
Environment variable usage and secure configuration  
File based context windows for logs or state  
Automation through simple loops and scripts  

## Typical Use Cases  
Developer assistants  
Local automation bots  
Scripting helpers  
Fast prototyping environments  

## Why This Matters  
CLI agents are lightweight, portable, and efficient.  
They can run locally without servers or graphical interfaces.

# Appendix F: Under the Hood: Inside the Agent’s Reasoning Engines  
(Cited from uploaded file Appendix F - Under the Hood_ An Inside Look at the Agents_ Reasoning Engines.pdf)  

## Core Concepts  
Chain of thought processes  
Reflection and self evaluation loops  
Planner and executor separation  
Intermediate reasoning traces  
Uncertainty and error detection  

## Why This Matters  
Reasoning engines transform LLMs into dynamic solvers.  
This appendix explains how planning, critique, and iteration produce goal aligned behavior.
