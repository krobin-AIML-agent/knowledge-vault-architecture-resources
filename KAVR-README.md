# Knowledge-Vault Architecture Resources

This repository contains a multi-domain knowledge system built from **82 individual summary documents**.  
Each document distills key ideas, models, or frameworks from books, research papers, military doctrine, technical courses, and other high-quality sources that shaped how I think and learn.

These summaries are not full books—they are **distilled mental models** that collectively wired my multidisciplinary cognitive architecture across engineering, AI, business, psychology, strategy, and operations.

The repository also includes resources for AI agent development, developer education, and system design.

## 🧠 Knowledge-Vault Overview (82 Summaries)

The Knowledge-Vault consists of **82 standalone summary documents**, each capturing the core principles from a source I studied.  
Together, these summaries form the backbone of my cognitive architecture.

### Domains Represented
- AI & Machine Learning  
- Data Engineering & Analytics  
- Process Improvement & Lean Six Sigma  
- Supply Chain & Operations  
- Psychology, Sociology & Human Behavior  
- Strategy, Economics & Competitive Advantage  
- Military Science & Leadership  
- Program & Project Management  
- Real Estate & Financial Systems  

Each summary is structured to capture concepts → frameworks → mental models → application.
