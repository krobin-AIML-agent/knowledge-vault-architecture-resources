## What's Inside

This repository contains guides organized into one main area:

### Foundational AI
Core knowledge base covering data analytics and artificial intelligence fundamentals.

- **[AI Breakdown](Foundational-AI/AI-Breakdown.md)** - Hierarchical taxonomy showing how AI → ML → Neural Networks → Deep Learning all connect
- **[AI Guide](Foundational-AI/AI-Guide.md)** - Overview of AI domains including ML, DL, NLP, Computer Vision, Robotics, Expert Systems, and Speech Recognition
- **[Data Analyst Guide](Foundational-AI/DataAnalystGuide.md)** - Complete roadmap covering statistics, Excel, and operational analytics with real CI/manufacturing examples
- **[The Basics of Top AI Concepts](Foundational-AI/The-Basics-of-Top-AI-Concepts.md)** - Modern AI systems: LLMs, RAG, AI Agents, and Agentic AI

## What Makes This Different

Unlike typical academic resources, this knowledge base:
- **Connects theory to practice**: Every concept includes operational applications
- **Uses real examples**: Manufacturing defect analysis, process optimization, CI workflows
- **Provides micro-steps**: Complex topics broken into manageable chunks
- **No BS approach**: Honest assessments of when to use (and not use) specific methods
