## What is Artificial Intelligence?

**Definition:**  
AI refers to any system or machine that performs tasks **normally requiring human intelligence**, like understanding, reasoning, learning, and decision-making.

---

## 1. Machine Learning (ML)

- A subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming.

### Key Types

#### Supervised Learning
- Learns from labeled data (e.g., email marked "spam" or "not spam").

**Use Cases:**
- Fraud detection
- Sales forecasting

#### Unsupervised Learning
- Learns from unlabeled data by finding patterns or clusters.

**Use Cases:**
- Customer segmentation
- Topic modeling

#### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns by trial and error using rewards/punishments.

**Use Cases:**
- Game-playing agents
- Robot navigation

---

## 2. Deep Learning (DL)

- A more advanced subset of ML using **neural networks with many layers** to process large amounts of data and complex patterns.

### Key Architectures

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Specialized for **image and video analysis**.

**Use Cases:**
- Face recognition
- Self-driving vision systems

#### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Designed for **sequential data** like time series or text.

**Use Cases:**
- Text generation
- Speech recognition

---

## 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Enables machines to **understand, interpret, and generate human language** — both written and spoken.

### Core Areas

#### Text Processing
- Tokenizing, cleaning, and organizing text.

#### Syntax & Semantic Analysis
- Understanding grammar and meaning.

#### Machine Translation
- Translating languages (e.g., Google Translate).

#### Sentiment Analysis
- Detecting emotions in text (positive, negative).

#### Chatbots
Automated conversational agents (e.g., ChatGPT, customer service bots).

---

## 4. Computer Vision

- Allows machines to **see, interpret, and understand visual data** like images and video.

### Techniques

#### Image Classification
- Labeling entire images (e.g., "cat" or "dog").

#### Object Detection
- Identifying and locating objects within images.

#### Image Segmentation
- Dividing an image into parts (like cells in a scan).

#### Facial Recognition
- Identifying people's faces in images or video.

---

## 5. Robotics

Combines AI with physical machines to **autonomously or semi-autonomously interact with the real world**.

### Key Components

#### Perception
Understanding surroundings using sensors (cameras, LiDAR).

#### Motion Planning
Deciding how to move safely and efficiently.

#### Control Systems
Executing the planned actions with precision.

**Use Cases:**
- Manufacturing arms
- Autonomous drones
- Delivery robots

---

## 6. Expert Systems

AI systems that **mimic the decision-making of a human expert** using logical rules and a structured knowledge base.

### Structure

#### Knowledge Base
- Stores facts and rules.

#### Inference Engine
- Applies logic to make decisions or suggestions.

**Use Cases:**
- Medical diagnosis systems
- Legal AI advisors

---

## 7. Speech Recognition

Converts **spoken language into text** and interprets audio signals.

### Key Functions

#### ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)
- Turns voice into words.

#### Speaker Identification
- Recognizes who is speaking.

**Use Cases:**
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Meeting transcription tools (Otter.ai)
