# Process Improvement & Lean Six Sigma

This section reflects how I understand process improvement, operational excellence, and performance systems based on the materials I worked through. The focus is on clarity, flow, waste reduction, measurement, and aligning processes with actual business outcomes.

## Power of Business Process Improvement

* Breaks down how to map processes, identify bottlenecks, and redesign workflows to reduce friction.
* Emphasizes clarity, documentation, and structured problem solving so teams can see the actual workflow instead of assumptions.
* Reinforces the idea that consistent improvement depends on visibility, ownership, and disciplined execution.

## Six Sigma Revealed

* Focuses on reducing variation and improving quality using DMAIC and statistical thinking.
* Highlights tools for root cause analysis, hypothesis testing, measurement systems, and data-driven decision making.
* Reinforces the role of structured analysis in improving reliability and operational performance.

## KPI Whitepapers

* Explain how to design meaningful performance indicators that connect to business results.
* Highlight the risk of tracking metrics that look good but do not drive decision making.
* Reinforce that KPIs should reflect flow, quality, cost, time, and alignment to strategy.

## Lean Six Sigma Toolkit

* Provides practical tools for waste elimination, process analysis, flow improvement, and statistical validation.
* Includes methods such as value stream mapping, cause and effect analysis, control charts, mistake-proofing, and standard work.
* Connects lean principles with six sigma rigor so improvements are both fast and reliable.

## Lean Operations from Womack

* Focuses on flow, takt time, visual management, and eliminating non-value activities.
* Reinforces the idea that operational excellence comes from designing systems that expose problems instead of hiding them.
* Highlights how lean thinking improves speed, quality, and cost simultaneously.

## TOC and SCOR Integrations

* Combines theory of constraints with the SCOR model to create a unified view of system performance.
* TOC identifies the constraint and SCOR structures the overall plan-source-make-deliver-and-return sequence.
* This integration helps unify improvement efforts, reduce system-wide bottlenecks, and align processes from end to end.

## Summary

* These notes connect process mapping, lean systems, six sigma analysis, KPI design, and constraint theory into one improvement framework.
* The main theme across all materials is building processes that are clear, measurable, and capable of improving continuously without added complexity.
* Together, these materials form a practical approach for diagnosing operational problems, redesigning workflows, and improving performance at scale.
