## Process Improvement and Lean Six Sigma
This section reflects how I understand process improvement, operational excellence, and performance systems based on the materials I worked through. The focus is on clarity, flow, waste reduction, measurement, and aligning processes with actual business outcomes.

### Power of Business Process Improvement
- Breaks down how to map processes, identify bottlenecks, and redesign workflows to reduce friction.
- Emphasizes clarity, documentation, and structured problem solving so teams can see the actual workflow instead of assumptions.
- Reinforces the idea that consistent improvement depends on visibility, ownership, and disciplined execution.

### Six Sigma Revealed
- Focuses on reducing variation and improving quality using DMAIC and statistical thinking.
- Highlights tools for root cause analysis, hypothesis testing, measurement systems, and data driven decision making.
- Reinforces the role of structured analysis in improving reliability and operational performance.

### KPI Whitepapers
- Explain how to design meaningful performance indicators that connect to business results.
- Highlight the risk of tracking metrics that look good but do not drive decision making.
- Reinforce that KPIs should reflect flow, quality, cost, time, and alignment to strategy.

### Lean Six Sigma Toolkit
- Provides practical tools for waste elimination, process analysis, flow improvement, and statistical validation.
- Includes methods such as value stream mapping, cause and effect analysis, control charts, mistake proofing, and standard work.
- Connects lean principles with six sigma rigor so improvements are both fast and reliable.

### Lean Operations from Womack
- Focuses on flow, takt time, visual management, and eliminating non value activities.
- Reinforces the idea that operational excellence comes from designing systems that expose problems instead of hiding them.
- Highlights how lean thinking improves speed, quality, and cost simultaneously.

### TOC and SCOR Integrations
- Combines theory of constraints with the SCOR model to create a unified view of system performance.
- TOC identifies the constraint and SCOR structures the overall plan source make deliver and return sequence.
- This integration helps unify improvement efforts, reduce system wide bottlenecks, and align processes from end to end.

## Summary
- These notes connect process mapping, lean systems, six sigma analysis, KPI design, and constraint theory into one improvement framework.
- The main theme across all materials is building processes that are clear, measurable, and capable of improving continuously without added complexity.
- Together, these materials form a practical approach for diagnosing operational problems, redesigning workflows, and improving performance at scale.
