# Strategy and Competitive Advantage

This section reflects how I view competitive advantage, corporate strategy, innovation, and strategic positioning based on the materials I studied. The goal is to stay practical and focused on the mechanisms that actually shape long-term advantage and organizational performance.

## What Is Strategy (Porter)

* Clarifies that strategy is about choosing what not to do and creating a differentiated position that competitors cannot easily replicate.
* Emphasizes fit across activities, tradeoffs, and consistency over time.
* Reinforces that operational effectiveness alone does not create sustainable advantage.

**Article**: [*What Is Strategy?*](https://hbr.org/1996/11/what-is-strategy) by Michael E. Porter, Harvard Business Review (November-December 1996)

## Resource-Based View (RBV)

* Focuses on internal capabilities such as skills, assets, culture, and intellectual property.
* Highlights that sustainable advantage comes from resources that are valuable, rare, costly to imitate, and organizationally supported.
* Connects directly to building strengths competitors cannot easily acquire or copy.

## Summary

* These notes consolidate how I understand competitive advantage, strategy formulation, innovation systems, and corporate-level decision making.

* Together, these materials provide a coherent view of strategy that connects market position, organizational capability, innovation, and investment logic.
