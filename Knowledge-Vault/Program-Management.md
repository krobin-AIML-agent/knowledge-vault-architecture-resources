# Project, Program, and Portfolio Management

This section captures how I interpret the core principles across project delivery, program governance, portfolio alignment, and organizational execution based on the PMI standards and practice guides I studied. The focus is on how structured systems drive predictability, clarity, and cross-functional coordination.

## PMBOK Seventh Edition

- Positions project management around principles and outcomes rather than rigid processes.
- Emphasizes value delivery, system thinking, stakeholder alignment, and tailoring practices to the environment.
- Reinforces that projects operate within larger organizational systems that influence success.

**Standard**: [*A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide)*](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok) - Seventh Edition, PMI

## Standard for Project Management

- Provides a consistent structure for initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing projects.
- Focuses on scope clarity, schedule integrity, cost control, quality, resources, communications, procurement, and stakeholder engagement.
- Helps anchor project work in disciplined planning and measurable performance.

**Standard**: [*The Standard for Project Management*](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok) (companion to PMBOK® Guide - Seventh Edition), PMI

## Standard for Program Management Fourth and Fifth Editions

- Highlights how multiple related projects are coordinated to achieve outcomes that exceed the sum of their parts.
- Emphasizes benefits management, governance frameworks, interdependency management, and strategic alignment.
- Reinforces the difference between delivering outputs and delivering long-term organizational benefits.

**Standard**: [*The Standard for Program Management*](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/program-management) - Fourth Edition (2017) and Fifth Edition (2024), PMI

## Standard for Organizational Project Management

- Connects strategy, portfolio management, program coordination, and project execution into one integrated operating system.
- Shows how organizations mature their capabilities to deliver consistent and repeatable results.
- Focuses on alignment between strategic objectives and the actual work being executed across teams.

**Standard**: [*Implementing Organizational Project Management: A Practice Guide*](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/practice-guides/opm), PMI

## Earned Value Management Standard

- Provides a performance measurement system that integrates scope, schedule, and cost.
- Reinforces how planned value, earned value, and actual cost reveal true performance against expectations.
- Helps identify variance early and supports objective forecasting.

**Standard**: [*Practice Standard for Earned Value Management*](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/practice-guides/earned-value-management) - Second Edition, PMI

## Risk Management Standard

- Breaks down how to identify, analyze, evaluate, and respond to risks across projects and programs.
- Emphasizes probability, impact, prioritization, mitigation, and contingency planning.
- Reinforces building a proactive risk culture instead of reacting to issues after they occur.

**Standard**: [*Practice Standard for Project Risk Management*](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/practice-guides/project-risk-management), PMI

## Requirements Management

- Focuses on capturing, analyzing, defining, validating, and tracing requirements across the lifecycle.
- Ensures alignment between stakeholder expectations, technical constraints, and delivered outcomes.
- Reduces rework by keeping scope and intent centralized and visible.

**Practice Guide**: [*Requirements Management: A Practice Guide*](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/practice-guides/requirements-management), PMI

## WBS Practice Guide

- Provides the structure for decomposing work into manageable components.
- Clarifies scope boundaries, ownership, deliverables, and reporting.
- Reinforces that a good WBS creates the foundation for planning, estimating, scheduling, and risk management.

**Practice Guide**: [*Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures*](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/practice-guides/work-breakdown-structures) - Third Edition, PMI

## Project Scheduling and Estimating Guides

- Explain how to build realistic schedules using dependencies, durations, critical paths, buffers, and resource constraints.
- Provide methodologies for top-down and bottom-up estimating, analogous estimating, parametric estimating, and three-point estimating.
- Highlight the relationship between assumptions, uncertainty, and reliable forecasting.

**Practice Guides**: 
- [*Practice Standard for Scheduling*](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/practice-guides/scheduling) - Third Edition, PMI
- [*Practice Standard for Project Estimating*](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/practice-guides/project-estimating) - Second Edition, PMI

## Summary

- These notes bring together the core ideas across project, program, and portfolio management including planning discipline, governance, risk management, benefits delivery, and performance measurement.
- The overarching theme is building predictable systems that operate with clarity, alignment, and measurable results.
- Together, these frameworks provide a coherent view of how organizations translate strategy into execution at scale.
