## Project, Program, and Portfolio Management
This section captures how I interpret the core principles across project delivery, program governance, portfolio alignment, and organizational execution based on the PMI standards and practice guides I studied. The focus is on how structured systems drive predictability, clarity, and cross functional coordination.

### PMBOK Seventh Edition
- Positions project management around principles and outcomes rather than rigid processes.
- Emphasizes value delivery, system thinking, stakeholder alignment, and tailoring practices to the environment.
- Reinforces that projects operate within larger organizational systems that influence success.

### Standard for Project Management
- Provides a consistent structure for initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing projects.
- Focuses on scope clarity, schedule integrity, cost control, quality, resources, communications, procurement, and stakeholder engagement.
- Helps anchor project work in disciplined planning and measurable performance.

### Standard for Program Management Fourth and Fifth Editions
- Highlights how multiple related projects are coordinated to achieve outcomes that exceed the sum of their parts.
- Emphasizes benefits management, governance frameworks, interdependency management, and strategic alignment.
- Reinforces the difference between delivering outputs and delivering long term organizational benefits.

### Standard for Organizational Project Management
- Connects strategy, portfolio management, program coordination, and project execution into one integrated operating system.
- Shows how organizations mature their capabilities to deliver consistent and repeatable results.
- Focuses on alignment between strategic objectives and the actual work being executed across teams.

### Earned Value Management Standard
- Provides a performance measurement system that integrates scope, schedule, and cost.
- Reinforces how planned value, earned value, and actual cost reveal true performance against expectations.
- Helps identify variance early and supports objective forecasting.

### Risk Management Standard
- Breaks down how to identify, analyze, evaluate, and respond to risks across projects and programs.
- Emphasizes probability, impact, prioritization, mitigation, and contingency planning.
- Reinforces building a proactive risk culture instead of reacting to issues after they occur.

### Requirements Management
- Focuses on capturing, analyzing, defining, validating, and tracing requirements across the lifecycle.
- Ensures alignment between stakeholder expectations, technical constraints, and delivered outcomes.
- Reduces rework by keeping scope and intent centralized and visible.

### WBS Practice Guide
- Provides the structure for decomposing work into manageable components.
- Clarifies scope boundaries, ownership, deliverables, and reporting.
- Reinforces that a good WBS creates the foundation for planning, estimating, scheduling, and risk management.

### Project Scheduling and Estimating Guides
- Explain how to build realistic schedules using dependencies, durations, critical paths, buffers, and resource constraints.
- Provide methodologies for top down and bottom up estimating, analogous estimating, parametric estimating, and three point estimating.
- Highlight the relationship between assumptions, uncertainty, and reliable forecasting.

## Summary
- These notes bring together the core ideas across project, program, and portfolio management including planning discipline, governance, risk management, benefits delivery, and performance measurement.
- The overarching theme is building predictable systems that operate with clarity, alignment, and measurable results.
- Together, these frameworks provide a coherent view of how organizations translate strategy into execution at scale.
