## Reasoning and Prompting

### Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting
A prompting method that improves reasoning by having models generate intermediate logical steps before producing an answer. This increases accuracy, interpretability, and performance on tasks involving math, planning, or multi-step logic.

## Reinforcement Learning Foundations

### RL with Verifiable Rewards
A reinforcement learning approach that uses objective and verifiable reward signals. This reduces reward hacking and strengthens alignment with correct behavior.

### RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
The training methodology used for many large language models. Models learn from human preference rankings, which produces safer, more natural, and intention-aligned responses.

### Atari DQN (Deep Q Network)
A landmark RL model (2013 to 2015) in which a neural network learned to play Atari games directly from raw pixels. This established deep reinforcement learning as a practical and scalable method.

## Neural Network Architecture and Optimization

### Dropout (Hinton)
A regularization technique that randomly drops neurons during training. This prevents co-adaptation, improves generalization, and reduces overfitting.

### AlexNet and ImageNet (2012)
A breakthrough convolutional neural network that demonstrated the power of deep learning in computer vision. Innovations included GPU training, ReLU activations, and deeper convolutional layers.

### Retentive Networks
A proposed alternative to transformer architectures. Retentive networks aim to support longer context, lower compute cost, and improved scalability for sequence modeling.

## Reliability, Grounding, and Safety

### Hallucination Research
Research into why models produce incorrect or fabricated outputs. Key areas include uncertainty, grounding, retrieval augmentation, calibrated reasoning, and safety mitigation techniques.

### AI Engineering by Chip Huyen
A detailed guide covering real-world machine learning production systems. Topics include deployment patterns, monitoring, drift detection, real-time inference, data pipelines, and model lifecycle management.

### Fundamentals of Data Engineering
A foundational text covering ingestion, storage, modeling, transformation, orchestration, and serving. These components form the infrastructure that supports modern AI systems.

### Algorithms for AI
A survey of classical and modern algorithms including search, heuristics, optimization, gradient descent, neural network architectures, and reinforcement learning.

### AI Student Handbook
A broad orientation resource for AI learners. Topics include machine learning concepts, math foundations, ethics, and research practices.

## Agentic Systems Architecture

### Agentic Systems (Autonomous and Multi-Step Agents)
Design patterns for building AI agents capable of planning, reasoning, and taking multi-step actions. Key components include goal decomposition, memory systems, tool use, action loops, environment interaction, safety layers, and multi-agent coordination.
