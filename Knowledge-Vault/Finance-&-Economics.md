## Finance and Economics
This section reflects the financial and economic fundamentals I pulled from the textbooks and materials I studied. The goal is to keep the concepts clear and practical so they translate directly into decision-making, valuation, and understanding how money moves through a business or investment environment.

### Brigham and Houston — Financial Management

- Emphasizes how firms make decisions about financing, investing, and distributing value to shareholders.
- Builds the foundation for understanding WACC, NPV, IRR, leverage, and how financial decisions impact firm value over time.

- Breaks down how to interpret financial statements beyond surface-level metrics.
- Concentrates on adjustments, accrual analysis, earnings quality, and understanding how accounting decisions shape reported outcomes.
