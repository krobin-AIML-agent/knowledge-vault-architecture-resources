## Supply Chain and Operations
This section captures how I understand the core principles of supply chain management, lean systems, constraint theory, and operational execution based on the books, whitepapers, and frameworks I have worked through. The focus is on the structural logic behind supply chains and how organizations reduce friction, improve flow, and scale reliably.

### The Toyota Way
- Emphasizes continuous improvement and respect for people as the foundation of operational excellence.
- Highlights concepts such as standard work, waste elimination, visual management, and problem solving at the source.
- Reinforces the idea that strong systems come from stable processes and disciplined execution.

### The Goal
- Centers on the Theory of Constraints and the importance of identifying the bottleneck in any system.
- Shows how operational flow, not raw efficiency, determines throughput and performance.
- Provides a practical blueprint for improving systems by focusing on constraints, buffers, and throughput.

### The Lean Startup
- Applies iterative testing, validation, feedback loops, and rapid learning to product and business development.
- Connects directly with supply chain thinking by focusing on cycle times, experimentation, and reducing waste in decision-making.

### Supply Chain for Startups
- Builds the foundation for designing early stage supply chains that scale without unnecessary complexity.
- Covers supplier selection, forecasting, production planning, logistics, inventory strategies, and cost control for new businesses.

### Principles of Supply Chain Management
- Breaks down core areas such as sourcing, logistics, operations, customer fulfillment, and network design.
- Reinforces the relationship between demand planning, capacity management, and operational reliability.

### Global Supply Chain Whitepapers
- Provide insight into emerging risks, geopolitical shifts, transportation disruptions, and global network resilience.
- Highlight real-world examples of how supply chains adapt under volatility and policy changes.

### KPI Frameworks
- Identify which metrics actually matter for supply chain performance including cycle time, fill rate, on time delivery, inventory turns, and defect rates.
- Emphasize connecting KPIs to root causes instead of tracking disconnected metrics.

### Supplier Performance Models
- Focus on evaluating suppliers through cost, quality, delivery, risk, and strategic alignment.
- Reinforce structured approaches for supplier scorecards, audits, and performance improvement.

### Post COVID Supply Chain Models
- Analyze how global networks adapted following disruptions in transportation, manufacturing, and labor.
- Highlight the increased importance of risk mitigation, nearshoring, redundancy, and digital visibility.

### SCOR Model
- Breaks supply chain operations into Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, Return, and Enable.
- Creates a unified framework for analyzing performance, process maturity, and operational capability across the entire value chain.

### Seven Rights of Supply Chain
- Reinforce the principles of delivering the right product, to the right customer, in the right quantity, in the right condition, at the right place, at the right time, and at the right cost.
- Serves as a simple and reliable mental model for evaluating end to end supply chain performance.

### Lean Supply Chain (Full TOC Book)
- Integrates lean principles, constraint theory, and flow management into supply chain design.
- Focuses on eliminating waste, stabilizing processes, shortening lead times, and improving overall throughput.
- Offers a systemic view of how supply chains behave under real world constraints.

## Summary
- These notes consolidate the core ideas across lean operations, constraint theory, supply chain strategy, supplier management, KPI structures, and global logistics.
- The emphasis is on understanding how flow, alignment, and system design shape real operational outcomes.
- Together, these materials provide a clear view of how supply chains function, how they break down, and what it takes to build systems that scale.
