# ML Resources 

## Neural Networks: Zero to Hero
- https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero?tab=readme-ov-file
    - A course on neural networks that starts all the way at the basics. The course is a series of YouTube videos where we code and train neural networks together. The Jupyter notebooks we build in the videos are then captured here inside the lectures directory. Every lecture also has a set of exercises included in the video description. (This may grow into something more respectable).
## Machine Learning for Beginners: A Curriculum
- [https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main)-
   - Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are pleased to offer a 12-week, 26-lesson curriculum all about Machine Learning. In this curriculum, you will learn about what is sometimes called classic machine learning, using primarily Scikit-learn as a library and avoiding deep learning, which is covered in our AI for Beginners' curriculum. Pair these lessons with our 'Data Science for Beginners' curriculum, as well!
## Data Science and Machine Learning Projects with source code
- https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Project-with-Source-Code/?tab=readme-ov-file
    - This repository contains articles, GitHub repos and Kaggle kernels which provides data science and machine learning projects with code.
## ML From Stratch
- https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch
  - The purpose of this project is not to produce as optimized and computationally efficient algorithms as possible but rather to present the inner workings of them in a transparent and accessible way.
