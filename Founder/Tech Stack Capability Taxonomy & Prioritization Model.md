# Tech Stack Capability Taxonomy & Prioritization Model

A unified framework for evaluating, classifying, and prioritizing tools across a full technical ecosystem.  
The model integrates four structural components: **taxonomy**, **capability metadata**, **functional descriptions**, and the **ecosystem relationship graph**.

---

## 1. Taxonomy  
Group all tools into clearly defined categories to understand breadth of coverage across the stack.

**Examples**  
- AI  
- Cloud  
- Database  
- DevOps  
- Analytics  
- Automation  
- Security  
- Integration  
- Productivity  
- Observability  
- Infrastructure  

This layer answers: **“What type of tool is this?”**

---

## 2. Capability Metadata  
Each tool is assigned prioritization metadata to determine importance, impact, and implementation difficulty.

**Priority**  
- Must Have  
- Should Have  
- Could Have  

**Impact**  
- High  
- Medium  
- Low  

**Effort (to adopt or integrate)**  
- High  
- Medium  
- Low  

This layer answers: **“How important is it and how hard is it to implement?”**

---

## 3. Functional Descriptions  
Each tool receives a concise functional capability description.

**Include:**  
- A short description  
- What the tool is used for  
- Its role/purpose within the ecosystem  

Examples of functional mapping attributes:  
- Core capability  
- Primary workflows  
- Key use-cases (80/20)  
- Dependencies  

This layer answers: **“What does it actually do in the ecosystem?”**

---

## 4. Ecosystem Relationship Graph  
Map how each tool connects, collaborates, or depends on others within the stack.

**Elements to capture:**  
- Direct integrations  
- API connectivity  
- Workflow connections  
- Data flow relationships  
- Cross-stack synergies  
- Upstream/downstream dependencies  

This layer answers: **“How does this tool interact with the rest of the system?”**

---

## Summary  
The **Tech Stack Capability Taxonomy & Prioritization Model (TS-CTPM)** provides a complete structural approach to:

- classify tools  
- evaluate importance and difficulty  
- define functional purpose  
- map system-wide relationships  

This creates a full capability matrix and ecosystem-level view suitable for architecture design, stack optimization, and strategic prioritization.
