# Knowledge-Vault Architecture Resources
### A Multi-Layer Enterprise Architecture for AI, Data, Automation, Systems Engineering, and Domain Intelligence

This repository is a unified, multi-disciplinary **Enterprise Architecture Knowledge System**.  
It integrates AI engineering, software architecture, interoperability, domain knowledge, program management, and Digital Production System design into one cohesive framework.

It functions as:

- A **technical handbook**
- A **complete training curriculum**
- A **multi-layer enterprise reference architecture**
- A **knowledge vault** for AI, engineering, strategy, and operations
- A **systems-level blueprint** for building scalable AI-driven companies
- An **end-to-end playbook** for agents, pipelines, automation, and governance

This is a **monorepo for intelligence systems**   built to unify the digital enterprise.

# 1. Core Philosophy

Modern enterprises operate across seven interconnected digital layers:

1. **Web Layer**
2. **Data Layer**
3. **Infrastructure Layer**
4. **Automation Layer**
5. **Intelligence Layer (AI/ML/Agents)**
6. **Observability Layer**
7. **Governance Layer**

This repository organizes knowledge, patterns, and architectures across all seven layers, ensuring:

- interoperability  
- clarity  
- scalability  
- reliability  
- strategic alignment  
- operational efficiency  

It supports both **technical roles** and **business/strategic functions**, enabling a complete view of how modern systems behave and evolve.
